#Purging All Unused or Dangling Images, Containers, Volumes and network

#Docker images consist of multiple layers. Dangling images are layers that have no relationship to any tagged images. They no longer serve a purpose and consume disk space.
#list 
docker images -f dangling=true
docker images purge

#Removing images according to a pattern
#list 
docker images -a |  grep "pattern"

#Remove a container upon exit
If you know when you’re creating a container that you won’t want to keep it around once you’re done
docker run --rm image_name

#Remove all exited containers
You can locate containers using docker ps -a and filter them by their status: created, restarting, running, paused, or exited. 
#List 
docker ps -a -f status=exited
docker rm $(docker ps -a -f status=exited -q)

#Remove containers using more than one filter
docker ps -a -f status=exited -f status=created
docker rm $(docker ps -a -f status=exited -f status=created -q)

#Remove containers according to a pattern
docker ps -a |  grep "pattern”
docker ps -a | grep "pattern" | awk '{print $3}' | xargs docker rmi

#Stop and remove all containers
docker ps -a
docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)
docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)

#Removing Volumes
docker volume ls
docker volume rm volume_name volume_name

#Remove dangling volumes - Docker 1.9 and later
docker volume ls -f dangling=true
docker volume prune

#Remove a container and its volume
If you created an unnamed volume, it can be deleted at the same time as the container with the -v flag
docker rm -v container_name
